# Interactive Credit Card UI

**Hello! I'm Ebrar AYTAÇ**

> *An aspiring Software Engineer dedicated to continuous self-improvement and creative coding.*

This repository contains a modern, interactive credit card checkout interface I designed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
Instead of boring white forms, I created a custom **"Nebula"** theme to make the user experience more enjoyable.
